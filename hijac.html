                <h4>Game name:</h4><p> Honey I joined a Cult</p>
                <h4>Platform:</h4><p> Steam, early access release</p>
                <h4>Duration of work:</h4><p> 3 months</p>
                <h4>Tools used:</h4><p> Adobe xD, Miro, Adobe Illustrator, pen & paper</p>
                <h4>My role & goals:</h4><p>As the sole UI/UX Designer on this project, my goal was to focus on providing solutions to player issues within the game identified through user testing and heuristic analysis. </p><p>My work involved improving usability as much as possible before release to Steam early access, alongside setting up the ground work for future updates. </p>
                <h4>The team structure:</h4><p> We took on a co-development role supporting Sole Survivor Games studio. Sole Survivor Games is a 2 person indie studio, and ‘Honey, I joined a Cult!’ is their first game.</p>
                  <p>Internally we had the support of our in house user research team who were able to conduct some fantastic user testing sessions throughout the project. Alongside this we had a small team for direct co-development, including production, UI artists, game designers and QA.</p>
              </div>

              <div id="context" class="pb-5">
                  <h4>Target demographic:</h4><p>In terms of game complexity we aimed the game at players who enjoy casual management/ base building genre, who will typically play games like Prison Architect, Two Point Hospital or Planet Zoo.</p> <p>They may find more complex games in the genre like Crusader Kings or Faster than Light a bit too complicated or unforgiving.</p>
                  <h4>Success metrics:</h4>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Improved internal user testing scores, and a decrease in issues identified with the game UI.</li>
                      <li>Upon release, a Steam user rating score which reflects this improved user testing score, along with a positive sentiment from Steam reviews.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <h4>Constraints: </h4><p>Development had been underway for a substantial period by the time I came onto this project, so scope for change was somewhat limited.</p>
                  <p>It was essential to prioritise key user issues within the game and work closely with the development team to implement them as efficiently as possible.</p>

              <div id="research" class="pb-5">
                <h2>Research</h2>
                <h4>Initial research: </h4><p>Along with being able to conduct my own heuristic analysis of the game as it currently stood, there were also insights from previous user testing sessions and reports. In tandem to this I carried out a short discovery period - familiarising myself with other games in and around the genre, whilst looking at player feedback online to see what went well or was disliked. </p>
                <p>In order to find a focus on these issues, I worked with the wider team to prioritise the issues found based on severity and cost to implement.</p>
                <h4>Key findings/ issues:</h4>
                <ul>
                  <li>There were several areas where the UI was unintuitive and confusing - in key areas of gameplay like building rooms and setting up missions this was particularly concerning.</li>
                  <li>Lack of consideration to player feedback, and a lack of events and gameplay goals, leading to confusion and boredom.</li>
                  <li>The UI was visually inconsistent and important considerations like localisation and accessibility had been missed.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Ongoing research:</h4><p> Throughout the project as prototypes for key features became ready to test, we were able to work with the user research team in conducting several further user testing sessions. Being able to observe these sessions was essential to enable us to validate our theories and progress confidently, with insights into where to ideate further when players would still be encountering unwanted friction.</p>

                <h2>Breakdown</h2>
                <p>Based on the research findings above, there are a variety of activities and processes I undertook over my time on the project to bring about improvements. Below are a few of the key steps taken:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>User & menu flow creation</strong><br>User and menu flows created to highlight inefficiencies and issues in the current game design. Created alternate flows to fix these issues.</li>

                <ul>
                  <li><strong>UI functionality rehaul</strong><br>Redesigned and recontextualised the approach to particularly problematic areas found in user testing (such as the way notifications and updates were handled - all game updates were delivered through toast pop ups the player had to dismiss).</li>

                  <li><strong>Wireframing & prototyping</strong><br>Paper and low fidelity wireframing in xD. Creating prototypes in xD to visualise flows and where neccessary to showcase possibilities for transitions and animations.</li>
